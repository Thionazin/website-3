		I'm Senhe, a computer science student interested in math and computing! Right now I'm looking for internships to get more experience with how things work in the industry. My hobbies include playing the trumpet, cooking, solving puzzles, competitive programming, reading, writing, and playing relaxing video games like Minecraft or Stardew Valley. In general I enjoy creating and building things as well as problem solving. The best part is when I get to see my final product in action, with the knowledge that I built that. Which leads to one of my lifelong goals. I want to learn and find as many answers as I can to the endless pile of questions in life.
